<h1>Shipment Price Prediction</h1>

The key factors that influence shipment prices:

1. **Distance/Shipping Route**
2. **Shipping Method/Mode (Air, Sea, Land, Rail, etc.)**
3. **Package Size and Weight**
4. **Packaging Requirements**
5. **Customs and Import/Export Duties**
6. **Delivery Speed (Transit Time)**
7. **Insurance and Liability**
8. **Fuel Costs and Surcharges**
9. **Volume of Shipment (Economies of Scale)**
10. **Carrier/Service Provider**
11. **Delivery Type (Door-to-Door, Residential vs. Business)**
12. **Special Handling (Hazardous, Fragile, etc.)**
13. **Seasonal Variations (Peak Seasons, Off-Peak Discounts)**
14. **Supply and Demand in the Shipping Market**
15. **Weight Distribution and Consolidation**


Hereâ€™s a short list of popular machine learning models commonly used for prediction tasks:

1. **Linear Regression**
2. **Decision Trees**
3. **Random Forest**
4. **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM) / XGBoost**
5. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
6. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
7. **Neural Networks (Deep Learning)**
8. **AdaBoost**
